            <h1>Books I Read in May 2024</h1>
            <p>Knife by Salman Rushdie recounts how the world-famous author survived an attempted murder at a literary event in New York in August 2022, over three decades after a fatwa was issued which forced him into hiding for several years. Rushdie manages to create suspense despite the outcome of the shocking attack being well known, and describes his distressing injuries and long recovery in some detail. The passage where Rushdie imagines a conversation with his attacker, who he refers to only as “The A”, is a creative and moving way of addressing such a traumatic event. Above all though, Rushdie is keen to emphasise that ‘Knife’ is also a love story. Many people were unaware that he had quietly married author and poet Rachel Eliza Griffiths less than a year before the attack, and the book is a moving tribute to her support. Rushdie said that writing about the attack was the only way he would be able to move forward, and I hope that this has helped him achieve that.

            <h1>Books I Read in April 2024</h1>
            <p>Pandora’s Box by Peter Biskind is about how the golden age of prestige television drama series in the early 2000s has evolved to an era of “peak TV” in which a saturated market produced 600 new scripted series in 2022 alone. It’s a three act story which begins with how the cable channel HBO distinguished itself from network television and found enormous success and critical acclaim with complex, gritty dramas such as The Sopranos at the turn of the century, inspiring several other series led by antihero protagonists. Then the DVD rental service Netflix disrupted everything, committing to series without pilots and introducing the concept of dropping all episodes of a series at the same time. And then its competitors arrived with tech giants creating their own streaming arms, notably Apple TV, Disney+ and Amazon Prime among others, churning out new series at great expense but not always succeeding in producing high quality content. Some of the detail about the financial side of the business is quite dry, but there are some interesting anecdotes about how some of the best known television dramas were made and why HBO rejected shows like Mad Men and House of Cards. Biskind is best known as a film critic and comes across as someone who doesn’t much care for television which results in an unusual and abrupt tone. However, his deep scepticism for the subject is well placed when discussing the flawed business models and rampant corporate greed in the industry. <a href="">Continue reading →</a></p>

            <h1>Books I Read in March 2024</h1>
            <p>A Tomb With a View by Peter Ross is a fascinating book about graveyards in Britain and Ireland and the stories of some well-known and forgotten residents as well as the work of those who care for them. The famous Victorian cemeteries in London such as Highgate and Kensal Rise face issues with limited space and expensive upkeep. Ross writes sensitively about a variety of subjects such as Muslim funerals in east London, the infant burial grounds known as cillini in Ireland, graveyards in Northern Ireland in the context of the Troubles and the work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission who recover the remains of soldiers found in northern France and trace the living relatives. Ross is a true taphophile – a lover of cemeteries – and a compassionate guide rather than an overly nostalgic one. ‘A Tomb With a View’ is an excellent book about reckoning with death in a life-affirming rather than morbid way. <a href="">Continue reading →</a></p>

            <h1>Books I Read in February 2024</h1>
            <p>A Life of One’s Own by Joanna Biggs is a blend of literary criticism and mini biographies of eight female authors and how they carved out creative freedoms for themselves, alongside Biggs’s personal reflections on her experience of going through a divorce in her 30s and losing her mother to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease a few years ago. In this book, she examines the lives and works of Mary Wollstonecraft, George Eliot, Zora Neale Hurston, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison and Elena Ferrante. Biggs demonstrated her skill at pen portraits in her 2015 book All Day Long about people at work and she is astute and concise in her analysis of how their hard-won independence is reflected in their work. <a href="">Continue reading →</a></p>

            <h1>Books I Read in January 2024</h1>
            <p>Wellness by Nathan Hill is set in the 1990s when Jack and Elizabeth meet as college students amid a vibrant art scene in Chicago. The novel follows the ups and downs of their relationship over the next 20 years through to middle age when they are married with a young son. Jack is a photographer while Elizabeth works at a wellness lab specialising in using placebos to treat disorders. The character development is exceptionally detailed, although some of the deep dives about psychology and algorithms could have been a little more concise. Still, unlike most doorstopper novels which deal with complex social issues – ‘Wellness’ is a hefty 600+ pages – it doesn’t take itself too seriously thanks to Hill’s sharp eye for humour and cynicism. I enjoyed Hill’s debut The Nix a lot and his second novel doesn’t disappoint. Many thanks to Pan Macmillan for sending me a review copy via NetGalley. <a href="">Continue reading →</a></p>
